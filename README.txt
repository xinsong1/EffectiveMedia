MATLAB code for Effective Media Theory

Overview
--------

The MATLAB code containing the following features

- Calculate 2nd order effective media tensor with Hexagonal symetry C11, C12, C13, C33, C44, C55 for Local Isotropy
- Calculate 2nd order effective media tensor and Voigt Average with Hexagonal symetry C11, C12, C13, C33, C44, C55 for Local Anisotropy

For an introduction, please have a look at the help first. Try the two example_script: LocalIsotropy/TestPlotIso.m and LocalAnisotropy/TestPlotAniso.m
